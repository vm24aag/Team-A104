# Write your general topic.  
topic: Investigating the Relationship Between Greenhouse Gas Concentrations and Annual Temperature Variations Across Global Regions

# Write your research question, following one of the three allowed templates.
# Be sure your question is all on one line.
RQ: Is there a correlation between annual temperature variations and greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O, and CFC-11) across global regions?

# Write your independent and dependent variables.  These should be the
# column names (reported by R colnames() where these variables are
# found in your dataset's CSV file.
# Note: if your question is about comparison of means, medians, or
# proportions, the independent variable column is the one that
# contains the values (at least two) that divide the population into
# subsets.
independent-var: Greenhouse Gas Concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11)
dependent-var: Annual Temperature Variations (Temp)

# Write the null hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
null-hypothesis: There is no correlation between greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11) and annual temperature variations.

# Write the alternative hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
alt-hypothesis: There is a correlation between greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11) and annual temperature variations.

# Write the dataset ID (KNNN):
dataset-id: DS329

# Write the dataset URL.  
dataset-url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/carbon-segment-values

# Write the dataset CSV filename, exactly as it appears on the Sharepoint list
# (which should be the same as the one in your repository!)
dataset-file: carbon-segment.csv

# Paste the output of loading your dataset into R, and executing the
# colnames() function, into the space below the `columns: |` line.
# Put two spaces *before* every line you pasted.
